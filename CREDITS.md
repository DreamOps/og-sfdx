# Credits

This Open Guide is meant to be a collaborative effort. It was as inspired by the [Open Guide to Amazon Web Services](https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws) and created by [@tedhusted](https://github.com/tedhusted).

We would like the content to be the result of a community of contributors, editors, and experts. Please help if you can. 

While the current focus of this Open Guide is packaging, scope can be increased to include all of the SFDX platform, given knowledgeable contributors (like you!). 

See the [Contributor Guidelines](CONTRIBUTOR_GUIDELINES.md) for notes on roles and editorial process.
