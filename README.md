A lot of information on Salesforce solution packaging has already been written.

 - Most people learn how to be a Salesforce ISV through Trailhead, the ISV Guide, and various help topics, which do cover all of the essentials.

 - Many of us go beyond the essentials by collaborating through the Salesforce Partner Communities and Salesforce Stack Exchange.

As Salesforce is a living platform that is continually improved, the information in forums or [Stack Exchange](https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/) cannot be consistently up to date.

 - All too often, we find out from other practitioners that we should have done this instead of that, and now there is no way to undo that. 

This unofficial, opinionated, open guide arose from the lessons that too many of us learned the hard way – and by observing the great success achieved by the [truly awesome AWS Open Guide](https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws).

The guide is written by-and-for package developers who use Salesforce solution packaging in the field.

It aims to be a useful, living, positive reference that consolidates links, tips, caveats, and best practices.

![(info)](info-16px.png) It's our way to help make a great platform even greater.

## Please help!

This guide is an early in-progress draft! It is a first attempt at assembling this information. It is far from comprehensive, and it will contain omissions and errors.

Please help by contributing to the guide so, unlike a blog, it can continuously improve. Like any open source effort, we combine efforts but also peer review to promote high quality.
